## Design

  The Design was to make it attractive for users of the site and to make it easy on the eye. 

### Colour Scheme
<h2 class="center"><img src="static/images/readme-image/color2.png"></h2>

- I got these five colours from the website called [coolors](coolors.co)
- #000000. This was for the writing of the website.
- #E5E5E5. This was for the background of the website.
- #FCA311. This was for hovering over links eg. nav bar. 
- #FFFFFF. This is the color in forms and car details.
- #14213D. This was used in the masthead in car details.

### Typography
-  'Barlow', Is my main font. I believe it to be attractive for the page.
- 'sans-serif' was chosen as fallback font.

### Imagery
- The Logo and Hero Pic is the only static images displayed on the website. All other images will be posted by users.

### Features to Add in the Future. 

- There is plenty of features i have in mind for this project and i wish i could of included more but with errors and time constraints i ran into problems. I will be putting these in after the grading. However the features i would include are:

- Profile log in so you can read about the user and possible see if they have sold cars on the site before.

- Contact Form sent to my email account along with my django admin account. I did try to include this feature but i was having
trouble with SendGrid who wouldn't authorise my email. [This link is what i tried to set it up with.](https://www.twilio.com/blog/build-contact-form-python-django-twilio-sendgrid). I will try this with gmail the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) in the future

- Signing up with Social Media Accounts.

- Search Bar that filters through cars.

- A feature to add multiple images and a video.

# Deployment

## Heroku

To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

### Create the Heroku App:
- Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) or create an account.
- On the main page click the button labelled New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".
- Enter a unique and meaningful app name.
- Next select your region.
- Click on the Create App button.

### Attach the Postgres database:
- In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.
- Copy the DATABASE_URL located in Config Vars in the Settings Tab.

### Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
- In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.
- Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file. 
- Update the settings.py file to import the env.py file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
- Comment out the default database configuration.
- Save files and make migrations.
- Add Cloudinary URL to env.py
- Add the cloudinary libraries to the list of installed apps.
- Add the STATIC files settings - the url, storage path, directory path, root path, media url and default file storage path.
- Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku.
- Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

### Create files / directories
- Create requirements.txt file
- Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage and templates.
- Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following: web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi

### Update Heroku Config Vars
Add the following Config Vars in Heroku:
- SECRET_KEY value 
- CLOUDINARY_URL
- PORT = 8000
- DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1

### Deploy
- NB: Ensure in Django settings, DEBUG is False
- Go to the deploy tab on Heroku and connect to GitHub, then to the required repository. 
- Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and either click Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deploys or Deploy Branch to deploy manually. Manually deployed branches will need re-deploying each time the repo is updated.
